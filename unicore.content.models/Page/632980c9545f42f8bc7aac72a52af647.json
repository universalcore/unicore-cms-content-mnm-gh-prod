Here is how malaria affected Ghana in 2012:\r\n\r\n - 100% of the population of Ghana was living in an at-risk area where the malaria parasite was present\r\n - It is estimated that 6,900,000 people caught the disease, and 17,000 died, just from a simple mosquito bite. \r\n - Malaria also cost the economy of Ghana approximately 5.7 Billion Cedi in lost productivity and treatment costs.\r\n\r\n**How you can help**\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.  You can help protect your family, and your country, from malaria by taking a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n - Make sure your whole family sleeps under a bed net every night.\r\n - Seek testing, and then treatment, from a doctor or health worker at the first sign of illness.\r\n - If you are given treatment, make sure to finish your pills!\r\n\r\nTo learn more about malaria in your county, visit the Ghana malaria program.\r\n",
